The mission of CIMPAD is to strengthen and promote public sector leadership in sustainable development of communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. The mission is achieved via the exchange of research and knowledge, ideas and proposals, experiences and best practices among public/private professionals, non-governmental organizations and academicians.  Formed in 1995, CIMPAD is governed by an elected board of directors and accepts invitations from sub-Saharan governments to assist them with challenges of their selection.  CIMPAD has worked with governments and NGO's in Ghana, South Africa, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.
