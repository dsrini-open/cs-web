I believe that teaching and learning are separate enterprises. A teacher is a learning facilitator. As such, the teacher has to possess knowledge of the subject matter, the ability to stimulate student interest in his or her subject and to intuitively know when his or her approach is effective. A student's acquisition of knowledge or enhancement of her or his base is a function of the extent to which the learners demonstrate familiarity with the matter and demonstrated ability to manipulate and synthesize. In the social sciences in general and in policy studies in particular it is necessary to contextualize subject matter. Contextualization facilitates the growth of handles that are necessary for students to grasp the matter and subsequently begin the learning journey. 

I employ what I refer to as longitudinalism as an approach to teaching, I conceive of it as a process of linking the past to the present. It is important to me that students find a 'handle' and use that handle to dissect, analyze and construct alternative realities. I have found this approach allows an understanding of the etiology of concepts and (it) allows learners with different beginnings to find a similar starting point. The different undergraduate backgrounds and life and work experiences of graduate students in public policy and administration study requires some sort of effort to find a common beginning to both teaching and learning. I have also come to know that a downside of this approach is my inclination to linger longer than is necessary on some events.
