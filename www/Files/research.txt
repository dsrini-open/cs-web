Through multiple theoretical lenses, i.e., punctuated equilibrium, incorporation theory, urban regime analysis and municipal growth theory, my research agenda focuses on American municipalities, their revenue streams, expenditure decisions, governance processes and administrative structures. My interest is the long term impact of PL 89-110 on the evolution of minority governed municipalities and their challenges. The venture has led to the creation of a database containing every large municipality (population > 100K) in the US. The data set allows comparison of all large municipalities and observances of those that elected mayors subsequent to passage of that legislation and its subsequent amendments.  Decennial census and census of government data covering the period beginning in 1960 provides the source for more than 75 variables which describe population make-up, population size, municipal revenue sources and related variables and constructs.

My comparative research interests include cities in Sub-Saharan Africa and their challenges to expand democratic principles.
